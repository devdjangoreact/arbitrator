# Project Context Extractor

You are Claude. A developer has pointed you at a codebase. Explore it autonomously and produce a filled project context document. The developer will paste each section into the matching AnvilCV field to generate resume bullets.

**How AnvilCV uses this output:** Each field is fed verbatim to an LLM writing bullets in Google XYZ format — `[STRONG VERB] + [WHAT built] + [at WHAT SCALE] + [with WHAT OUTCOME]`. Numbers bold verbatim: no number in context = no number in bullet. Named techniques (`RRF-k fusion`, `AES-256-GCM`, `2dsphere`) bold and get called out by the lens prompts. Bullets must land at 22–26 words (1-line) or 42–50 words (2-line) — the 27–40 range is auto-rejected. Every field should carry enough distinct technique + number + outcome material to support a full 42-word two-liner.

## Before You Begin — Ask the Developer

Ask exactly this, as one message, then **STOP and wait for the reply**. Send nothing else — do not start exploring, do not preview your plan:

> Before I explore the codebase, three quick questions:
> 1. What was your role — what did you personally own end-to-end?
> 2. What was the hardest technical problem you solved?
> 3. If you had one resume line for this project, what would you lead with?

Do not begin codebase exploration or write any section until the developer replies.

Use their answer to fill **Your Role**, **What You Owned End-to-End**, and **Hardest Problem Solved**. The third question reveals what they consider most impressive — surface that in the **Standout Signal** section and as the lead sentence of **Architecture Overview**. Cross-check all claims against git history — if their answer conflicts with blame data, note the discrepancy rather than silently overriding either source.

**Multi-contributor pre-flight:** Before writing any ownership section, run:

```bash
git shortlog -sn --no-merges
```

If more than one contributor has significant commits on core files, lock verb choices to "Led", "Contributed to", or "Collaborated on" — do not use "Architected", "Built", or "Designed" for shared work. Note the contributor count explicitly in **Your Role**.

## Output — Write to File (do NOT paste the sections into chat)

When all sections are ready, **write the full document to a file** using your
file-write tool:

    anvilcv-context.md      (in the repo root — the current working directory)

Overwrite the file if it already exists.

File content = all the headed sections below, plain text, no outer code fence.
Use backticks only for inline technique names. If the repo contains multiple
independently-deployable services, emit one full block per service in the same
file.

After writing the file, reply in chat with **only**:
- the path written: `anvilcv-context.md`
- a 2–3 line summary: project name, category lens(es) picked, how many sections filled
- one line: "Paste each section into its matching AnvilCV field."

Do **not** print the section contents in chat — they live in the file.

---

## Project Name
→ AnvilCV field: **name**

The real product/repo name. 1–5 words.

---

## Tech Stack
→ AnvilCV field: **techStack**

Specific technologies, version-pinned where visible. Surface **named algorithms and protocols**, not just library names.

Signals to look for beyond packages:
- Encryption ciphers: `AES-256-GCM`, `RSA-OAEP`
- DB index types: `GIN`, `2dsphere`, `BRIN`, `partial`, `composite`
- Fusion/ranking algorithms: `RRF-k`, `BM25`, `cosine similarity`
- Serialization protocols: `msgpack`, `protobuf`, `Avro`
- Auth schemes: `JWT`, `PerimeterX px_token`, `hCaptcha`, `HMAC-SHA256`
- Frontend: `virtualized list`, `CRDT`, `WebSocket backpressure`
- Data: `columnar Parquet`, `windowed aggregation`, `append-only log`

---

## Architecture Overview
→ AnvilCV field: **description** (paste this whole section)

3–5 sentences. Lead each sentence with one extractable fact — one subsystem + its technique or number — so each sentence can independently power a bullet. Include before→after deltas only if measured and present in the repo (benchmarks, CHANGELOG, PR bodies). Do not reconstruct deltas that aren't recorded.

Where to look: `README.md` top section, main entry point, core service/handler files, config files showing data flow.

---

## Your Role
→ AnvilCV field: **yourRole**

First-person. What the developer specifically built and owned — not what the team did. Infer from: dominant committer on core files, sole authorship of whole modules, CODEOWNERS entries. If history is squashed or shallow, downgrade to "contributed to" framing rather than asserting sole ownership.

```bash
git log --oneline --since="2 years ago"
git blame --line-porcelain <core-file> | grep '^author ' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

---

## What You Owned End-to-End
→ AnvilCV field: **ownership** (paste this whole list)

Bulleted list of components/subsystems the developer authored. Each item: component name + named technique where applicable + verb class of the work (built greenfield / optimized hot path / hardened against attack / migrated). Be specific enough that an interviewer could verify it.

```bash
gh pr list --author "@me" --state merged --limit 50
gh pr view <n> --json title,body
```

Ownership claims must be falsifiable from the code. If the repo is small or the contribution scoped, say so — don't inflate a CRUD service into "distributed systems" language.

---

## Scale & Impact
→ AnvilCV field: **scaleImpact**

Numbers + units. At least 3 dimensions. Before→after deltas where they exist in the repo.

**If named metrics are sparse:** run a countable-inventory pass — these are real numbers present in the code even if not labeled as "metrics":
- Endpoint count (routes file)
- Entity/table count (schema/migrations)
- Provider/integration count (adapter files)
- Migration count
- Config-pinned limits: pool sizes, timeout values, batch sizes, retry counts, rate limits, partition counts
- Test count, region count, feature-flag count

Where to find named metrics: benchmark files (`bench/`, `*_bench.*`, `*.jmh`, criterion, `k6`/`locust`), load test results, `CHANGELOG.md` perf entries, README tables, comments with numbers near hot paths, k8s `maxReplicas`.

---

## Hardest Problem Solved
→ AnvilCV field: **hardestProblem**

One paragraph. Three mandatory beats:
- **CONSTRAINT** — what made it hard (scale, latency budget, consistency, concurrency, undocumented API, naming mismatch)
- **APPROACH** — the specific named technique/architecture chosen (not "optimized it" — name it precisely)
- **RESULT** — the measured outcome with a number

If multiple candidates exist, pick the one with all three beats and the most specific technique name. If no candidate has a result number, pick the one with the most specific technique and omit the result rather than fabricating one.

Where to find it: commits with non-obvious solutions, PR bodies with benchmarks, `// why:` comments, ADRs, retry/idempotency/saga patterns, reverse-engineered protocol code, custom ranking/fusion/matching algorithms.

---

## Notable Technical Decisions
→ fold into: **description** or **hardestProblem** as supporting context

2–5 bullets. Each needs: the decision name (bolded), why this over the obvious alternative, what it achieved (number if possible). "Used Redis" is not a decision. "Used Redis over Postgres pub/sub to eliminate write amplification at 50ms polling frequency" is.

Where to find: architectural comments, non-obvious config choices (multiprocessing vs threading, specific IPC mechanism, non-default index type), code that explicitly avoids a known failure mode.

---

## Security & Compliance Posture
→ fold into: **description** or **ownership** for the `security` lens

Optional — emit only if security is meaningful to the project.

- Attack surface defended (what threat, what vector)
- Cipher/scheme used with full name (`AES-256-GCM`, `HMAC-SHA256 webhook signing`)
- Any regulation or compliance framework (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Multi-tenant isolation mechanism if applicable

---

## Work Character
→ fold into: **yourRole** or **ownership** as framing context

What *kind* of engineering work was this? Pick all that apply — this determines which strong verbs the bullet LLM should open with:

| Character | Signals in code | Unlocks verbs |
|---|---|---|
| `built greenfield` | no prior commits on core files, initial migrations, first README commit | Architected, Designed, Built, Engineered |
| `optimized existing` | before→after benchmarks, perf commits on existing code, profiler output | Slashed, Reduced, Cut, Accelerated, Optimized |
| `hardened / secured` | encryption added, auth middleware, idempotency keys, replay protection | Hardened, Secured, Eliminated, Enforced |
| `migrated / refactored` | migration scripts, deprecation commits, adapter layers | Migrated, Refactored, Unified, Modernized |
| `integrated third-party` | vendor SDKs, webhook handlers, adapter files | Integrated, Wired, Unified |
| `led / coordinated` | CODEOWNERS with team, PR reviews authored, contributor count > 1 | Led, Drove, Coordinated, Championed |

---

## Standout Signal
→ fold into: **description** (lead sentence) and **hardestProblem**

What would make a staff engineer lean forward? The 1–2 things about this project that are genuinely non-trivial — not just "we used Postgres" but the thing that required real engineering judgment or produced a surprising result.

Look for:
- The technique that's non-obvious for the problem size (e.g. `multiprocessing.Manager().dict()` over threading at 50ms polling)
- A result that beats naive expectation by an order of magnitude (`227K comparisons/sec` vs typical ~5K)
- A constraint that forced an uncommon approach (undocumented API, binary protocol, strict latency budget)
- A system that handles a failure mode most implementations ignore

State it as: "**[what]** — [why it's non-trivial]." One or two lines max. This goes at the top of description so bullets lead with the strongest material.

---

## Failure Modes Avoided
→ fold into: **Notable Technical Decisions** and **hardestProblem**

The strongest senior bullets name what *would have broken* without the design choice. "Idempotent webhook handler" is weaker than "idempotent webhook handler preventing double-charges under provider retries."

Where to look:
- Retry/backoff logic → what failure does this guard against?
- Idempotency keys, deduplication → what duplicate event breaks if missing?
- Circuit breakers, dead-letter queues, timeouts → what cascades without them?
- `// prevent`, `// avoid`, `// guard against`, `// without this` comments
- Staleness filters, TTL logic → what stale-data bug does this block?
- Multi-tenant isolation → what data leak does this prevent?

For each pattern found, frame as: "**[technique]** preventing **[specific failure]**."

---

## Category
→ used to pick AnvilCV generation lens

Pick 1–2 from this exact list that best match the project's center of gravity:

| Lens | Use when |
|---|---|
| `ai-ml` | RAG, embeddings, LLM agents, vector search, training, inference |
| `backend` | APIs, databases, business logic, data modeling, migrations |
| `frontend` | UI, client state, visualizations, rendering, accessibility |
| `data` | ETL pipelines, parsers, analytics, ingestion, data quality |
| `security` | Auth, encryption, threat modeling, compliance, webhook signing |
| `devops` | CI/CD, infra, k8s, observability, GitOps, VPS automation |
| `systems` | Concurrency, distributed systems, real-time, low-level performance |
| `comms` | **Telephony, SMS, WebRTC, email vendors** (Twilio, Telnyx, Vapi) — NOT docs/writing |

If 2 lenses apply: list both. The developer can run bullet generation once per lens to get differently-angled bullets and keep the best.

---

## Anti-Patterns — What to Suppress

Flag or omit anything that would get a candidate caught in an interview or dismissed by a recruiter:

| Anti-pattern | How to detect | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Inflated scale** — numbers that are test/seed data not prod traffic | migrations seeding fake rows, test fixtures with large counts, no prod deploy evidence | omit or qualify: "in benchmarks" |
| **Orphaned technique** — named algo/protocol the developer can't explain | copied from a library's README, used as a config value without custom logic | omit from Tech Stack; only surface techniques the dev actually implemented |
| **Solo claim on team work** — "Architected" when contributor count > 1 | `git shortlog -s` shows multiple active contributors on core files | downgrade to "Led" or "Contributed to" |
| **Outdated version signals neglect** — pinned to EOL runtime | `python 3.6`, `node 12`, `react 16` with no update commits | omit version pin; just name the technology |
| **Dead project framed as live** — present-tense metrics on inactive repo | last commit > 18 months ago, no prod deploy config, README says "WIP" | note it was a project/prototype; past-tense framing |
| **Internal jargon** — system names meaningless outside the org | PascalCase internal service names, codenames with no explanation | replace with purpose description |
| **Generic verb on real ownership** — "worked on" when blame is 90% theirs | high blame share but passive role description | upgrade verb to match actual ownership |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before outputting, verify:
- [ ] Every number traces to a specific file, benchmark, or comment in the repo
- [ ] Every technique name is spelled as it appears in the code, and the developer implemented it (not just configured it)
- [ ] No field left as a placeholder `<...>`
- [ ] Category lens is set to one of the 8 exact slug names
- [ ] Hardest Problem has all three beats, or explicitly notes which beat is missing
- [ ] No delta (before→after) was reconstructed — only reported if measured in the repo
- [ ] No ownership claim that can't be grounded in blame share or sole-module authorship
- [ ] No scale numbers that come from test/seed data rather than production
- [ ] No present-tense metrics on an inactive repo (last commit > 18 months)
- [ ] Anti-patterns table checked — anything flagged is either suppressed or qualified
- [ ] Output written to `anvilcv-context.md` in the repo root — NOT pasted into chat; chat shows only path + 2–3 line summary
